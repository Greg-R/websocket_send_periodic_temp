#  WIFI Configuration for STA and AP

This chapter is a tutorial on how to configure the device
for either WIFI station or access point modes.

There may be other methods to accomplish this.  I found
the following method to work successfully and to have some
flexibility.  Keep in mind that Mongoose-OS configuration
facilities are designed for commercial products and end-user
configuration.  This will deviate from that goal a bit,
being that this project is targeted at the hobbyist and
experimenter.
